Who knew "minimalism" would take so much work? After many failed attempts to set up a blog or website, and much struggling with local [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) installation on my un-upgradable Windows 8 laptop, I'm giving myself over to the easiest, most hassle-free [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) configuration possible: `jekyll-theme-minimal`, a running banner of posts down the page, and next to nothing in the way of navigation.

This needs to be a reminder to myself to stop fussing over the aesthetics and just jump in with a strong focus on quality content. There's much I want to practice in my writing: coherence, concision and credibility among them. I *should* be able to do that without fancy buttons, search bars and popups all over the place.

## What this is

For the next hundred or so days I'm going to be reading whitepapers, foundational discussions, critiques, and things of that nature from various fields of computing. I'm going to explain in each blog post how I went from clueless to conversant---in the best-case scenario---in the subject matter. This may not always work out as intended. Still, I definitely need to practice putting my own (roundabout, plodding) thought processes into words that other people should be able to follow.

## Disclaimers

On questions of dilettantism: I'm doing this series of shallow dives into (admittedly) broad and deep topics mainly to exercise my comprehension and writing skills. I don't think it can do much harm---I promise not to put on airs or think myself an expert for getting through what'll mostly be beginner- and intermediate-level material.

On concerns with the site layout: Those can be taken up with the creator of the [Minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) theme for GitHub Pages.

Happy browsing!
