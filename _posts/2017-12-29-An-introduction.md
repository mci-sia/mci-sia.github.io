Who knew minimalism took so much work? After many failed attempts to set up a blog or website, and much struggling with local Ruby and Jekyll installation on my un-upgradable Windows 8 laptop, I'm giving myself over to the easiest, most hassle-free GitHub pages configuration possible: `jekyll-theme-minimal`, a running banner of posts down the page, no links.

This needs to be a reminder to myself to stop fussing over the aesthetics and start focusing on the content of things. There's much I want to practice in my writing: coherence, concision and credibility among them. I *should* be able to do that without fancy buttons, search bars and popups littering this site.

So. For the next hundred or so days I'm going to be reading whitepapers, foundational discussions, critiques, and things of that nature from various fields of computing. I'm going to explain in each blog post how I went from clueless to conversant (at best) in the subject matter.

On questions of dilettantism: I'm doing this series of shallow dives into (admittedly) broad topics mainly to practice my comprehension and writing skills. I don't think it can do much harm---I promise not to put on airs or think myself an expert for getting through what'll mostly be beginner- and intermediate-level material.

On concerns with the site layout: Those can be taken up with the creator of the [Minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) theme for GitHub Pages.

Happy browsing!
